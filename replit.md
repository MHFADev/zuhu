# Recent Changes

## October 2, 2025 - Performance Optimization & Lightweight Animations

### Performance-First Animation System
- **Removed Heavy Libraries**: Eliminated Framer Motion and GSAP to improve load times and reduce bundle size
- **CSS-Only Animations**: Implemented lightweight, performant CSS animations including:
  - `pulse-subtle`: Gentle pulsing effect for logo and loading elements
  - `spin-slow`: Smooth 3-second rotation for decorative elements
  - `fade-in`: Smooth entrance animation for content
  - `slide-up`: Upward slide with fade for staggered content reveals
  - `shimmer`: Animated shimmer effect for progress bars and highlights
- **Server Startup**: Optimized to ~2.4-3 seconds (previously slower with animation libraries)

### Loading Screen Implementation
- **Elegant Entry Experience**: Created visually appealing LoadingScreen component with:
  - Spinning gradient ring around logo (orange/amber/yellow theme)
  - Smooth progress bar with shimmer effect
  - Staggered content animations (fade-in ‚Üí slide-up sequence)
  - Bouncing food emojis (ü•ü üç° ü•ê) with delayed timing
  - Smooth exit transition (fade-out with scale effect)
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Built entirely with React hooks and CSS animations
- **Performance**: 2-second loading duration with smooth 500ms exit animation

### Header Logo Animation
- **Subtle Interactions**: Added gentle hover and idle animations to logo:
  - Continuous pulse-subtle effect for subtle presence
  - Hover: scale(1.1) + rotate(5deg) with smooth transition
  - Orange glow effect on hover matching brand colors
- **Lightweight**: Uses only CSS transitions and animations, no JavaScript libraries

### Technical Performance Improvements
- **Bundle Size**: Significantly reduced by removing Framer Motion (~90KB) and GSAP (~50KB)
- **Load Time**: Faster initial page load and Time-to-Interactive
- **Animation Performance**: All animations run on GPU-accelerated CSS properties
- **Memory Efficiency**: No animation library overhead or cleanup requirements

### Design Consistency
- Maintained orange/amber gradient scheme throughout all animations
- Consistent timing functions (ease-in-out, ease-out) for smooth motion
- Cohesive visual language across loading screen, header, and page transitions

## September 30, 2025 - Initial Design Implementation
